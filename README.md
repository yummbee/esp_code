This repo is intended to be used as a reference for esp32 code done in C (currently, if there is demand i will include the arduino framework).

The project was built using the PlatformIO extension on VSCode and ESP-IDF. 

If you wish to add code please do not dump all code into the main.c, create a C file under the respective sub folder.
